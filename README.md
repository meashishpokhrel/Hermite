# QE_process
The purpose of these codes is to share my ideas of using Quantum Espression for CaTiO3 for variety of computations.
1) Lattice constant
2) Kinetic energy cut-off
3) k-point grid sampling
4) gnuplot scripts for band gap, density of state, partial density of states and other plots.
Please give me your feedback after using these codes.
